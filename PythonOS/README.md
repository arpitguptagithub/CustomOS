# ArpitOS

## About
This is a basic operating system mock-up made using the Python GUI module tkinter. It includes a few interactive apps for navigation.

There are two main screens in the OS. Initially, you'll see the welcome screen, where you need to enter your password within 5 tries. Upon successful login, you'll enter the app drawer, where you can choose from a grid of apps.

## Setup and Usage
**Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, download Python 3 from [here](https://www.python.org/).**<br>
**Note: If you encounter a tkinter error while running the file, you may need to install tk separately on your system.**
